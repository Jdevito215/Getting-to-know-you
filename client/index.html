            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am Joey Devito and im currently majoring in Computer Science here at Lewis. I have a great family which consists of my mom who is always there to help do what she can to support me, and my 2 older brothers who have also always been present in my life and have assisted me throughout it. I am currently looking to pursue this degree because of my large interest for technology which has always existed ever since a young age which started with the gameboy. Im currently a Senior and plan to graduate in December, with this course being one of two last requirements needed. Im hoping this semester goes smoothly and i can gain more knowledge into the world of software and code before launching myself into reality. Some more generic information about myself is that i love animals, music, video games, connections with people, history/science, and astronomy.

            <h2><u>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</u></h2>
            <p>
                For me, i always enjoyed relaxing or having fun by playing video games or listening to music, specifically fps games with some of my friends. Currently I have been playing competetive fps games such as Overwatch or Valorant (They are both pretty bad to endure). For music, i almost always have my spotify playing in some way, whether im outside, at the gym, playing games, or just talking with friends. I currently listen to alot of alternative rock, indie/alternative, with some pop here and there.  However, i intend to learn on playing the acoustic guitar as another form of relaxation and i hope to get to a comfortable point to where i can play songs i enjoy. Another thing i forgot to mention, i also get comfort out of being with my rabbit or dog.
